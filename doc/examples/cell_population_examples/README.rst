This folder contains a working example for using SamuROI on cell populations:

- 'data.npy' is the image sequence to be analyzed.
- 'GCaMP.ilp' is an example ilastik project file, that is used by the ilastik functions.

Note: this example requires that ilastik (http://ilastik.org/download.html) is installed on your machine.
